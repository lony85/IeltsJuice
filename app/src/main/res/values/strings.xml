    <string name="Q_consultation_06">Is a high speed Internet connection necessary?</string>
    <string name="A_consultation_06">Yes. You will be in an audio and/or video call with your teacher, so you’ll need a good Internet connection, but today in most parts of the world, the speed is even higher than needed.</string>

    <string name="Q_selfPaced_05">Will I need any books to study during the online course?</string>
    <string name="A_selfPaced_05">The course materials are more than enough for learning the techniques and strategies. But you definitely need to use the books recommended in the courses for test practice.</string>
    <string name="Q_selfPaced_06">What if I have a question?</string>
    <string name="A_selfPaced_06">No worries! Every course has its own question and answer forum where you can get help from our IELTS experts and other students in the course.</string>
